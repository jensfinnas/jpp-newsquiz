# Reinventing the news quiz

This is an experiment with gameification of news quizzes using timing and life counts.

It is a result of a mini hackathon at the J++ Stockholm Summit 2015.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
